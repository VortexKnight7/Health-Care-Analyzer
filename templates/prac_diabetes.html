        Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called
        blood sugar, is too high. Glucose is your body&apos;s main source of
        energy. Your body can make glucose, but glucose also comes from the
        food you eat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that helps glucose get into
        your cells to be used for energy. If you have diabetes, your body
        doesn&apos;t make enough or any insulin, or doesn&apos;t use insulin
        properly. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn&apos;t reach your
        cells.

          The most common types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and
          gestational diabetes.
        </p>
        <li>Type 1 diabetes:-</li>
        <p>
          If you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no insulin.
          Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas
          that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children
          and young adults, although it can appear at any age. People with
          type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.
        </p>
        <li>Type 2 diabetes:-</li>
        <p>
          If you have type 2 diabetes, the cells in your body don’t use
          insulin properly. The pancreas may be making insulin but is not
          making enough insulin to keep your blood glucose level in the normal
          range. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes. You are
          more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you have risk factors,
          such as overweight or obesity, and a family history of the disease.
          You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood.
        </p>
        <li>Gestational diabetes:-</li>
        <p>
          Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during
          pregnancy. Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after
          the baby is born. However, if you’ve had gestational diabetes, you
          have a higher chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.
          Sometimes diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is type 2 diabetes.
        </p>
        <li>Prediabetes:-</li>
        <p>
          People with prediabetes have blood glucose levels that are higher
          than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed with type 2
          diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you have a higher risk of
          developing type 2 diabetes in the future. You also have a higher
          risk for heart disease than people with normal glucose levels.
        </p>
        <li>Other types of diabetes:-</li>
        <p>
          A less common type of diabetes, called monogenic diabetes, is caused
          by a change in a single gene. Diabetes can also come from having
          surgery to remove the pancreas, or from damage to the pancreas due
          to conditions such as cystic fibrosis NIH external link or
          pancreatitis.
